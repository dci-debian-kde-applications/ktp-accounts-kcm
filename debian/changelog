  [ Maximiliano Curia ]
  * New upstream release (15.12.2).

  [ George Goldberg ]
  * Add a README file with basic information, an INSTALL file telling how to build the app, and a patches directory containing the same patch for QtDBus that is included with telepathy-accountmanager-kwallet (I must get this into qt-copy as soon as it switches to 4.5).
  * Add basic parts of buildsystem.
  * Add a desktop file for the kcm module.
  * Add compileable stub KCM implementation.
  * Add widgets to the main page of the KCM.
  * Remove random wtf member variable of non-existant type...
  * Add a categorized sort-filter proxy model and disable copying of the main class.
  * Add a stub model for the accounts list.
  * Set up an AccountManager and have it becomeReady() on startup of the KCM.
  * Once the accountmanager is ready, load up all the accounts and get them ready too.
  * Reimplement pure virtual methods in AccountsListModel.
  * Add an instance of the AccountsListModel and also fix up the slot that deals with the accounts becoming ready to use the latest tpqt4 api.
  * Add a stub class AccountItem.
  * Telepathy Accounts are now becomeReady()'ed by the AccountItem wrapping them.
  * Seems it only took one more line to make the AccountItem handle the account becoming ready completely.
  * Start to implement the internal storage of the AccountsListModel.
  * Actually add the accounts to the model once we get them from the account manager.
  * Add signals to the AccountItem that will tell the model when it has changed in some way which is relevant to the model.
  * Implement rowCount() and data() methods on the accountsList model.
  * When an account becomes ready, we should add it to the accessible part of the model.
  * Actually display the available accounts in the view.
  * Display the accounts under the categories VALID and INVALID in the accounts list view.
  * Improve the implementation of adding a row to the accounts list model and implement removing a row.#
  * Rough and ready port to TpQt4 0.1.8.
  * Tidy up the code a bit. - Use kdelibs coding style consistently. - Remove some cruft. - Make method names a bit more sensible. - Use ASSERTS properly so that non-debug builds give a warning where they happen.
  * Fix signal-slot connectio.
  * Add skeleton class for AddAccountWizard.
  * Add a skeleton class for the ProtocolSelectWidget along with a ui file for it.
  * Add the ProtocolSelectWidget as the first page of the add account wizard.
  * Show the AddAccountWizard when you click on the Add Account button in the UI.
  * Add some extra kDebug()'s and some comments.
  * In KDE we have Assistants, not Wizards.
  * When we load the first ProtocolSelectWidget, get the list of Telepathy Connection Managers installed on the system.
  * Add bare bones of the model and items for the ProtocolSelectWidget.
  * Pass const references to Tp::*Ptr objects, rather than passing by value.
  * Namespace Telepathy has changed to Namespace Tp.
  * Set up the model and add the connection managers when they become ready.
  * C&P error--
  * Remove patches directory since they are all now fixed in upstream Qt, and update INSTALL to reflect this and a couple of other fixes.
  * kDebug()++ and -- in methods that get called meaninglessly often.
  * Create the ProtocolItems in the protocol selection model.
  * Actually get the protocols displaying in the list.
  * Continue to the next page of the add account assistant if a protocol is selected.
  * Enable cancelling and tidy up correctly after it in the add account assistant.
  * kDebug()++
  * Make page 2 of the assistant a KTabWidget, as we are going to be introducint tabbed ui to that page soon.
  * Add a ParameterEditWidget class. This class will provide the autogenerated fallback parameter-editing widget for the addAccount assistant.
  * Add a method to set the parameters of the ParametersEditWidget and create a stub delegate for displaying the widgets in the item view for autogenerated account editing UIs.
  * Add parameter-edit-widgets to the second page of the add account assitant.
  * Add a ParameterEditModel for the ParameterEditWidget.
  * Now we have a ParameterEditModel, we can create it and the view and delegate to go with it.
  * Add a skeleton class ParameterItem which will be used to populate the ParameterEditModel.
  * Populate the EditParameterModel with the parameters.
  * Add roles for the different bits of data that might be requested from the ParameterEditModel and add getters to the ParameterItem to get them.
  * Display labels and lineEdits for each item in the EditParameter view.
  * Little bit of tidyup, removing some annoying kDebug() statements adding a couple of missing lines.
  * Show bool parameters as checkboxes.
  * compiler warnings--
  * Connect to the slots on the parameter edit widgets to see when their data is changed.
  * Correctly detect if a parameter is of type bool, as well as setting data back to the model when parameters are edited in the view.
  * Fix bug where the item editing widgets got the wrong values in them.
  * Add an IntegerEdit class which provides a lineEdit field which only allows valid integers to be in it.
  * Fix focus problem with parameter items edit widgets, and also treat integers as strings when they are entered in the IntegerEdit to avoid deleting all digits from the edit causing it to change to 0.
  * Add a UnsignedIntegerEdit for editing parameters of type uint.
  * When editing parameters, display asterisks if the parameters are secret.
  * Improve the appearance of the Accounts List view. - Add a checkbox to enable/disable accounts. - Show their icon in the view. - Update the item in the view when its display name or state change.
  * Show a message box telling you to enter all mandatory parameters if they aren't entered when you click finished.
  * Pass the AccountManagerPtr into the Add Account Assistant.
  * Actually add the Account on the AM when we click Finish in the Add Account Assistant.
  * Bump minimum version of TelepathyQt4 required to 0.1.9 now it has been released.
  * Add a signal to the ProtocolSelectWidget that is emitted whenever the selected protocol is changed.
  * Add a singleton Dictionary class which will contain a list of common parameter names to enable translation of them.]
  * Populate the parameter dictionary with the current parameters supported by gabble on jabber accounts.
  * Display translated parameter names if possible in the autogenerated Parameter Edit UI.
  * Build a library called libkcmtelepathyaccounts which will, to begin with, house all the classes needed for the account ui plugins. It may also house the stuff that should be in a library for access from Kopete too.
  * Write the code for registering/returning the protocols provided by the plugin. This should probably be done with some kind of factory, but we can do without that for now ;).
  * Add AbstractAccountUi shell class (and installed headers).
  * Fill out the AbstractAccountUi class with methods for storage/retrieval of the supported parameters.
  * Add a pure virtual method to AbstractAccountUiPlugin to get the AccountUiPlugin for a given protocol/cm combo.
  * Add pure virtual methods to AbstractAccountUi to get the actual parameter widgets.
  * Add a stub AbstractAccountParametersWidget abstract class along with its installed headers.
  * Fill out and implement the rest of the AbstractAccountParametersWidget class.
  * Make the KCM link against the plugin interfaces library.
  * Create a barebones implementation of the Gabble Account UI plugin.
  * Implement removing of accounts.
  * Register provided protocol/cm combos in the gabble plugin.
  * Comply with a small API correction, and misc tidyup.
  * Show new accounts in the list when they are created on the Account Manager. Also delete the AddAccountAssistant when it is finished so that it can be launched again.
  * Add stub singleton PluginManager class.
  * Load all plugins when we initialise the plugin manager.
  * Add a PluginMacros header which contains the Plugin Export macro for account ui plugins.
  * Add a .destkop file for the accountuiplugin servicetype.
  * Add a method to get the AbstractAccountUi from the PluginManager.
  * Add support for more than one widget displaying optional parameters.
  * Calling delete d; in a constructor considered harmful. :'( Also, some other tidyup and some clarity fixes.
  * Show the autogenerated UI only when there are parameters not handled by any custom UIs in place in the Add Account Wizard.
  * Support showing a custom UI for the mandatory parameters too.
  * Make the Back Button work in the Add Account Assistant.
  * Show the icons for the protocols in the Add Account Assistant's first page. The icon names follow the same naming scheme as Empathy. We'll need to get them moved out of Kopete's protocol folders at some point so that they can be installed accessible for all Telepathy enabled apps.
  * Q_DISABLE_COPY in private and explicit constructors.
  * Implement the most basic possible implementation of the rest of the plugn, up to displaying a blank widget for the mandatory parameters.
  * Remove junk file added in error.
  * Make the code in the Add Account Assistant that decides what parameterwidgets to show actually work correctly with plugins.
  * Add a method to AbstractAccountParametersWidget to check if the current input state of the widgets will provide valid (to the best of the UI's knowledge) values, and to alert the user if not.
  * Move all code that is part of the default autogenerated parameter-edit-widgets to its own subdirectory.
  * Make ParameterEditWidget inherit from AbstractAccountParametersWidget.
  * Refactor AddAccountAssistant to make its code a bit simpler now that EditParametersWidget inherits from AbstractAccountParametersWidget.
  * Stick with a loop and deletelater() since qDeleteAll calls only delete, and I don't think this is good practice with widgets with signal/slot connections all over the place.
  * Rely on the AbstractAccountParametersWidget classes to validate their parameter values.
  * #include MOC output in all QObject subclass cpp files.
  * Add optional-parameter-edit-widget and mandatory-parameter-edit-widget classes to handle the parameter value validation in the generic parameter editing UI.
  * Implement validateParameterValues() for MandatoryParameterEditWidget.
  * Show a custom widget for the mandatory parameters for adding gabble/jabber accounts.
  * Make Add Account Assistant use OptionalEditParameterWidget and MandatoryEditParameterWidget instead of just ParameterEditWidget in the generic UI, so that validationParameterValues() works correctly.
  * Implement checking all mandatory paramters are filled in.
  * Add a stub class for the edit-account dialog.
  * When the Edit button is clicked, display the EditAccountDialog.
  * Destroy the edit account dialog when it is closed.
  * Get accounts ready with all features (I reckon we need all the existing ones at the moment).
  * Show the apropriate parameter-edit-widgets in the edit account dialog. Does not yet prepopulate them with existing values.
  * Support pre-populating the parameter edit widgets for the case when we are editing an account, not adding it.
  * Save changes when editing accounts. Editing accounts now works.
  * Bring up to date with latest libkcmtelepathyaccounts API, and make the gabble mandatory parameters widget support editing.
  * Fix library name to remove the double lib prefix from it.
  * Fix FindKCMTelepathyAccounts.cmake to not use the double lib prefix.
  * Move IntegerEdit and UnsignedIntegerEdit classes to the lib so that they can be used by plugins.
  * Add value() methods to the custom type widgets to get their current value in the appropriate type (not as a QString).
  * Add a widget for the optional server-related parameters.
  * Add the ServerSettingsWidget to the list of optional widgets the plugin has.
  * Add a widget for proxy/stun/conference server settings.
  * If no value is provided for a given parameter, set the widget to show its default value.
  * Don't forget to register the Telepathy DBus types before we use tpqt4.
  * Move all the other files used by Kopete into the library.
  * Uncomment line giving widgets focus in the ParameterItemDelegate after they have been set up (because otherwise widgets were still getting the wrong values in them).
  * Fix bug where accounts were added with parameters that had not been changed from the default.
  * Fix typo which caused https proxy port parameter to have the wrong default value.
  * Fix bug where parameters with the default value were not unset when editing the account.
  * Enable the account after we create it.
  * Reduce the amount of NIH (by using QValidators for int/uint types, rather than some crappy broken homebrew (yeah, it was my fault) validation code. Also make the validation results available through the model.
  * Use the new validation code to validate all the parameters when we add/edit an account.
  * Use new validation support on int and uint entry fields.
  * Remove empty directories that were left behind by git-svn.
  * Hack around the password-now-optional change in gabble - this will be fixed properly when I finish my refactoring branch of the kcm
  * Password is no longer mandatory.
  * Hack the Hack to make it not crash when using a CM where password is mandatory.

  * BUG: 246218
  * Make sure we only connect to the account item onTitleUpdated slot once.
  * Added very basic butterfly(MSN) config UI plugin.
  * Compile against Telepathy-Qt4 0.5 Change to returning a QVariantMap of parameters as changed in telepathy-
  * Set correct maximum port number (65535).
  * Typecast port numbers to uint before setting as QVariant. Without this the DBus connection complains it is receiving the wrong type.
  * Compile against Telepathy-Qt4 0.5 Changed account abstract-account-parameters-widget.h to return QVariantMap of parameterValues() instead of trying to QMap<ParameterItem,QString> which didn't compile.
  * Remove double margin on account edit widget
  * Add an icon to the 'advanced' button.
  * Make use of AccountFactory This reduces the complexity of the account list model as it no longer needs to maintain two lists for ready and unready account.
  * Incorporated Review comments from dario freddi http://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/100293/
  * Change the parameterValues return value to a QList<ProtocolParameter> class This is a new class which effectively is a structure of parameter value pairs. The main reason for this is to revert the behaviour to not save any parameter which has the value the same as the default.
  * Incorporated review comments from George Goldberg Added missing license header.
  * Remove superfluous debug message.
  * Match latest KCMAccounts library + added review comments
  * Add missing pretty header
  * added icon
  * Refactor AccountEditWidget to pass ProtocolInfo rather than several QStrings seperately. This simplifies bits of code and reduces the chance of sending garbage data to the account edit widget. Also gives the account edit access to the protocol icon.
  * Show a protocol title and icon on the edit widget
  * Add missing colon on field label.
  * Fix whitespace issues in header file.
  * Add connection state to the Accounts Model
  * start of a delegate to view online state

  * Convert item delegate to KWidgetItemDelegate so it can contain a checkbox And a big tidy up of the paint() method.
  * Update model with checkbox state changes.
  * Renamed dataChanged() signal from the account list delegate.
  * Added review comments, and reverted an unnecessary change.
  * Add author data to the KDE About data.
  * Add getters for set/unset parameters to the ParameterModel Deprecated the class "ProtocolParameterValue" as it was basically the same as Parameter-item.
  * Renamed ambiguous "setParameters" method, to "parametersSet" Explicitly call submit() on the data widget mapper, this fixes a bug of sometimes not values in the form.
  * Set widget data mapper to not update until we call submit(); We call submit anyway, so this saves a bit of pointless processing.
  * Remove #includes on a file which isn't needed (and no longer exists)
  * Remove unused class and an existing reference to it.
  * Make sure a display name is set when adding an account. Sovles a bug where a user cannot add a local-xmpp account.
  * Add Florian Reinhard to authors of the accounts KCM as he did most the plugins
  * Check account properties exist before setting them
  * Add a google talk specific profile UI.
  * Minor code tidy ups. Review comments from Dario Freddi
  * Added Cmake install for profile files
  * Updated parameter edit model to keep track of profile parameters Removed work around that set default value on first creation based on profile parameter.
  * Disable non-editable edit fields where the value comes from a profile and is fixed
  * Rebased with master
  * Regenerate icon when changed. This fixes a bug when creating a new account with a profile, as the profile is not loaded straight away.

  [ Gustavo P. Boiko ]
  * Make the dialogs modal and use a simpler method to set the config pages' title. This commit also makes the editting of accounts a resposibility of the kcm module instead of doing that in the item itself.
  * Set the page titles in the windowTitle property
  * - The account edit dialog now shows only one dialog containing all the main options for the protocol, and optionally an advanced button which opens one second dialog containing extra options.
  * Port the current plugins to the main/advanced config scheme
  * Oups, add the widget to the second page layout. SVN_SILENT
  * Make sure the values are properly loaded if the advanced dialog is opened twice
